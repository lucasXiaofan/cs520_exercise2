## Running Tests

### Run all tests with pytest:
```bash
pytest test_all_problems.py -v
```

### Run with coverage (line and branch):
```bash
pytest test_all_problems.py -v --cov=deepseek_cot_solutions --cov-report=term-missing --cov-branch
```

### Run specific test class:
```bash
pytest test_all_problems.py::TestProblem6 -v
```

### Generate HTML coverage report:
```bash
pytest test_all_problems.py --cov=deepseek_cot_solutions --cov-report=html --cov-branch
# Open htmlcov/index.html in browser
```

## Coverage Analysis

The coverage report will show:
- **Line coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed during tests
- **Branch coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches taken
- **Missing lines**: Specific lines not covered by tests

Example output:
```

```

## Notes

- Failed solutions contain algorithmic or implementation errors
- Passed solutions successfully handle all provided test cases
- Coverage metrics show which code paths were executed during testing
- Some solutions may have correct logic but fail due to edge cases

## Chain-of-Thought Strategy

The CoT strategy uses explicit step-by-step reasoning:
1. UNDERSTAND: Analyze input/output and constraints
2. PLAN: Design algorithm and data structures
3. EDGE CASES: Identify special cases
4. IMPLEMENT: Write clean, correct code

This systematic approach achieved 57.1% success rate on these interview-level problems.
