## Coverage Analysis Report - Multi-Model Solution Variants

**Models Used**:
- DeepSeek V3 (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3)
- Gemini Flash 2.0 (gemini-2.0-flash-exp)

**Prompt Strategies**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Planning

**Test Framework**: pytest with pytest-cov

## Important Notes

**Disclaimer**: This analysis uses solutions generated by two LLM models (DeepSeek V3 and Gemini Flash 2.0) with two different prompting strategies each (CoT and Self-Planning), resulting in up to 4 solution variants per problem. However, Gemini Flash 2.0 frequently generates code that is not properly parseable or fails to follow the required structure, resulting in some problems having only 1-3 parseable solutions instead of the maximum 4. The coverage numbers below reflect testing across all parseable solution variants for each problem.

Most solution logic not exercised by single test case. Nested DP loops and branches mostly untested.                                                          |

Example: `[2,1,3,5,4] → 3`                                      | **1/1 ✓**    | 8.0% (2/25)  | 12 branches (0 partial)      | **Low coverage (5% overall)**: 3 parseable solutions available. Single test case insufficient to exercise multiple code paths.

Single test case barely touches the solution space. Complex nested loops and conditional logic almost entirely untested.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

All conditional branches and loops fully exercised.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| solution_7.py  | Problem 7  | **Contains Cycle in Grid** - Find if cycle exists in 2D grid with same-value cells (path length ≥ 4, adjacent moves only, no backtracking). Uses DFS with visited tracking.                                     | **1/1 ✓**    | 28.9% (26/90) | 68 branches (7 partial)    | **Low coverage (23% overall)**: 4 parseable solutions (max). Single test case with simple grid barely exercises DFS recursion. Most edge cases and cycle detection paths untested.                                                                                                      |

Test exercises basic DP logic but misses many recursive paths and edge cases in the state space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| solution_10.py | Problem 10 | **Least Operators to Express Target** - Find minimum operators (+, -, *, /) to express target using only value x. Example: `x=3, target=19 → 5` (expression: `3*3+3*3+3/3`)                                     | **1/1 ✓**    | 12.8% (5/39) | 20 branches (0 partial)   | **Very low coverage (8% overall)**: Only 2 parseable solutions. Single test case minimally exercises the complex recursive DP. Most optimization paths and edge cases remain untested. |
| solution_11.py | Problem 14 | **Longest Common Subsequence** - Find length of longest common subsequence between two strings. Classic DP problem. Example: `"abcde", "ace" → 3`                                                               | **1/1 ✓**    | 8.1% (3/37)  | 18 branches (0 partial)      | **Very low coverage (5% overall)**: 3 parseable solutions but single test insufficient. 2D DP table building logic mostly untested.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| solution_12.py | Problem 11 | **Exchange Sort** - Find minimum exchange operations to sort sequence of three key values (7, 8, 9). One operation swaps two elements. Example: `[9,9,7,7,8,8] → 4`                                             | **3/3 ✓**    | 17.1% (7/41)  | 24 branches (0 partial)     | **Low coverage (11% overall)**: 4 parseable solutions (max). Despite 3 test cases, swap logic and counting operations remain largely untested across variants.                             |
| solution_13.py | Problem 12 | **Minimum Total (Triangle)** - Find minimum path sum from top to bottom of triangle. Each step moves to adjacent numbers in row below. Example: `[[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]] → 11`                            | **2/2 ✓**    | 70.2% (40/57)    | 34 branches (9 partial)      | **Good coverage (58% overall)**: 3 parseable solutions with 2 test cases achieving decent coverage. Bottom-up DP mostly exercised but some edge cases have partial branch coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| solution_14.py | Problem 13 | **Longest Consecutive Sequence** - Find length of longest consecutive elements sequence in O(n) time. Example: `[100,4,200,1,3,2] → 4` (sequence: [1,2,3,4])                                                    | **1/1 ✓**    | 8.3% (2/24)  | 18 branches (0 partial)      | **Very low coverage (5% overall)**: 3 parseable solutions. Single test barely touches the hash-based logic. Sequence detection and edge cases remain untested.                                                                                                           |


# Part 2
## decision to change from APP benchmark to BigCodeBenchmark 
- sourece of new benchmark: https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcodebench
![alt text](need_harder_code1.png)
and 
![alt text](image.png)
just show that the APP benchmark used in exercise one is very simple, and the uncovered branch is impossible to cover because those condition will never be true with valid input.
